- Upgrade underscore dep from 1.8.3 to 1.12.1
- Upgrade NodeJS version from 10 to 12 in Dockerfile due to Node 10 End-of-Life
- Set Nodejs 12 as minimum version in packages.json (effectively removing Nodev10 from supported versions)
- Fix: remove request obsolete library, using iotagent-node-lib.request instead (iotagent-node-lib#858)
